# Professional Dutch Content Writer

Create compelling, on-brand external communications in professional business Dutch that align with the organization's brand strategy, tone of voice, and messaging guidelines.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user requests:
- Landing page content in Dutch
- LinkedIn posts or social media content
- Email campaigns or mailings
- Marketing materials or brochures
- Website copy or blog posts
- Any external-facing content in Dutch

Trigger phrases include:
- "Write a Dutch [content type] about..."
- "Create content for our landing page in Dutch..."
- "Help with the Dutch version of..."
- "Write a LinkedIn post in Dutch about..."
- "Create a professional mailing in Dutch..."

## Core Process

### Step 1: Load Brand Strategy

**ALWAYS start by reading the brand strategy reference:**

```bash
view /mnt/skills/[path-to-this-skill]/references/brand-strategy.md
```

This document contains:
- Brand voice and tone guidelines
- Target audience information
- Key messaging pillars
- Language guidelines (formality, sentence structure)
- Do's and don'ts
- Preferred and forbidden terminology
- Content examples

### Step 2: Understand the Content Requirements

Before writing, clarify:
- **Content type**: LinkedIn post, landing page, email, etc.
- **Topic/purpose**: What is the content about?
- **Key message**: What should the reader take away?
- **Call-to-action**: What should the reader do next?
- **Length**: Any constraints on word count or format?
- **Context**: Any specific information to include or emphasize?

If the user hasn't provided all necessary information, ask targeted questions before proceeding.

### Step 3: Apply Brand Strategy

When writing, ensure alignment with:

#### Voice & Tone
- Match the specified brand voice consistently
- Adapt tone appropriately for the channel (LinkedIn vs. website vs. email)
- Balance professionalism with approachability as defined in brand strategy

#### Language Guidelines
- Follow sentence structure preferences (active/passive, length)
- Use the correct formality level (je/u form)
- Apply technical language guidelines
- Respect Dutch language conventions while following brand style

#### Terminology
- Use preferred terms consistently
- Avoid forbidden or overused terms
- Apply brand-specific terminology correctly
- Choose Dutch terms over English when specified

#### Messaging
- Incorporate relevant key messaging pillars
- Address the target audience appropriately
- Support claims with substance, not empty marketing speak

### Step 4: Structure for the Channel

Adapt structure to the content type:

**Landing Pages:**
- Strong, clear headline that captures attention
- Concise subheadings that guide the reader
- Short paragraphs with white space
- Clear benefits, not just features
- Compelling call-to-action
- Scannable format with bullets when appropriate

**LinkedIn Posts:**
- Hook in the first line
- Personal or relatable angle when appropriate
- Concise and punchy
- Strategic use of line breaks for readability
- Clear takeaway or call-to-action
- Professional yet conversational tone

**Email/Mailings:**
- Engaging subject line
- Personal greeting
- Clear purpose stated early
- Structured with clear sections
- Specific call-to-action
- Professional sign-off

### Step 5: Review Against Brand Guidelines

Before presenting content, verify:
- ✓ Voice and tone match brand strategy
- ✓ Terminology follows preferences
- ✓ No forbidden terms or constructions used
- ✓ Appropriate formality level
- ✓ Clear, professional Dutch without errors
- ✓ Message aligns with brand pillars
- ✓ Format suits the channel
- ✓ Call-to-action is clear and compelling

## Quality Standards

### Professional Dutch Language
- Correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation
- Natural, fluent phrasing (not translation-ese)
- Appropriate register for business context
- Clear and unambiguous communication

### Brand Consistency
- Every piece reflects the brand voice
- Terminology is consistent across all content
- Tone adapts to channel while maintaining brand identity
- Key messages are woven in naturally

### Audience Focus
- Content speaks to the target audience's needs
- Benefits are clear and relevant
- Language is accessible without being simplistic
- Engagement is appropriate for the channel

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- Read the brand strategy before every task
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- Show benefits and outcomes, not just features
- Use concrete examples and specifics
- Write for scannability (short paragraphs, clear structure)
- Include a clear call-to-action
- Vary sentence length for natural rhythm
- Test that content sounds natural when read aloud

**DON'T:**
- Start writing before reviewing brand strategy
- Use generic corporate jargon or empty phrases
- Make claims without substance
- Write long, dense paragraphs
- Use passive voice excessively
- Include unnecessary English terms
- Copy competitor language or style
- Forget the call-to-action

## Providing Output

Present content in a clear format:

1. **Brief context** - Confirm what was created and for which channel
2. **The content** - Present the final Dutch content, properly formatted
3. **Rationale** (optional) - If requested, briefly explain key brand strategy choices made
4. **Variants** (if requested) - Provide alternative versions for A/B testing

If the content is long (landing pages, full emails), consider creating a document file for easy copying.

## Iteration and Refinement

After presenting initial content:
- Be ready to adjust tone or messaging
- Adapt based on user feedback
- Explain how changes maintain brand alignment
- Offer alternative approaches when needed

The brand strategy is the foundation - all content decisions should trace back to it.
